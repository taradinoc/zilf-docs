# ZILF Documentation
ZILF is a set of tools for working with the ZIL interactive fiction language, including a compiler, assembler, disassembler, and game library. A lot of existing documentation, tutorials, and reference guides have been written for ZILF, ZIL (MDL and Z-Code) so this documentation effort is going to be pushed in three stages.

## Stage 1: Knowledge Organization
This stage is mostly about gathering existing documentation and organizing the knowledge using a simple knowledge organization system (SKOS) schema. During this stage, preliminary information architecture will be stubbed out for the next stage.

## Stage 2: Information Architecture
After organizing all of the knowledge into a SKOS schema, this stage is about developing simple entry points into the documentation. Gap analysis will take place during this stage.

## Stage 3: Filling the Gaps
If there are any gaps identified during the previous stage, we will write documentation to present a complete set of documentation for ZILF and its associated technologies.

As this work takes place, please reference the existing documentation in the [ZILF heptapod repo](https://foss.heptapod.net/zilf/zilf).
